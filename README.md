# BIONIC HAND
<p>This repository contains the code, models, and resources for developing a real-time signal classification system for a bionic hand. The project focuses on classifying Electromyographic (EMG) signals from the forearm muscles of amputees into six distinct action classes. The classified actions are then used to control a prosthetic hand, enabling more natural and intuitive movement for the user.</p>
<h2>Data Collection</h2>
<p>The dataset consists of EMG signals collected from the forearm muscles of participants. These signals were recorded using non-invasive surface electrodes placed at specific locations on the forearm. The data captures the electrical activity generated by muscle contractions when the user attempts different hand movements.</p>
<h2>Data Preprocessing</h2>
<p>To ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model, the raw EMG signals underwent several preprocessing steps:</p>
<ul><b>Noise Removal</b><p>Unnecessary frequencies and noise were filtered out to enhance the quality of the signals.</p></ul>
